# UPJ-Programming
Programs I have worked on to some degree of functional since I started school at UPJ
Most, if not all of these were assignments for labs to different lectures i had. 
If a folder of programs or a good majority of programs would suddenly get pulled down
From here, that would be because a professor(probably) asked me to do so.
